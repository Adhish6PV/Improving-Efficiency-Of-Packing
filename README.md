This is a group project completed by the below mentioned.


* Adhish PV

* Pannaga S

* Janardhan M

* K Pranav

We're 6th sem mechnanical engineering students from Ramaiah Institue Of Technology, Bangalore, India. We have worked on a project named 'PALLET LOADING PROBLEM' for our mini project. Our goal of the project is to use an algorithm to pack both homogeneous and heterogeneous boxes on the pallet.

# We have acheived the following results:

* Homogeneous Box Packing:

    ~ Packing Efficiency Achieved by Hollow Block Heuristics = 98.97%

* Heterogenous box Packing:

    ~ Percentage of Area Covered = 99.20%

    ~ Volumetric Efficiency By Using bIASED RANDOM KEY GENETIC ALGORITHM = 80.73%

# Note

* To Access the contents, codes, it should be opened through FANUC Roboguide Software V9.1.0.
* Heterogeneous Box Packing and Hollow Block Heuristics have 2 parts, to access them, it is advised to move the contents from each part to a single folder and opened using above-mentioned software.
