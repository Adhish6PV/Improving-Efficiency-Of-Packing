We're 6th sem mechnanical engineering students from Ramaiah Institue Of Technology, Bangalore, India. We have worked on a project named 'PALLET LOADING PROBLEM' for our mini project. Our goal of the project is to use an algorithm to pack both homogeneous and heterogeneous boxes on the pallet.

# We have acheived the following results:

* Homogeneous Box Packing:

Packing Efficiency Achieved by Hollow Block Heuristics = 98.97%

* Heterogenous box Packing:

Percentage of Area Covered = 99.20%

Volumetric Efficiency By Using DFTRC-2 Heuristic = 80.73%
